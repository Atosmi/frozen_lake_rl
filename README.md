# Frozen Lake Solution

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that implements a solution to the Frozen Lake problem using reinforcement learning.

## Problem Description

The Frozen Lake problem is a classic reinforcement learning problem where an agent has to navigate a 4x4 grid of tiles that represent either frozen ice (F) or holes (H). The agent starts at the top-left corner (S) and has to reach the bottom-right corner (G) without falling into any holes. The agent can move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. However, the ice is slippery, so the agent may not end up in the intended tile. The agent receives a reward of 1 if it reaches the goal and 0 otherwise.

The problem can be represented as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with 16 states (one for each tile) and 4 actions (one for each direction). The transition probabilities and rewards are given by the OpenAI Gym environment `FrozenLake-v1`.

## Solution Approach

The solution approach used in this notebook is based on Q-learning, which is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns a state-action value function Q(s, a) that estimates the expected return from taking action a in state s and following a fixed policy thereafter. The Q-learning algorithm iteratively updates the Q-values using the Bellman equation and an exploration-exploitation trade-off strategy such as epsilon-greedy.

The notebook contains the following sections:

- Importing the libraries and creating the environment
- Defining the Q-learning algorithm and the hyperparameters
- Running the Q-learning algorithm and plotting the results
- Evaluating the learned policy and visualizing the Q-table
